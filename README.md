## Simple and minimalistic retro and material inspired theme
* A very simple theme that were made completely on my phone, with arch linux running in chroot.
![Screenshot](/preview.jpg?raw=true)
* Screenshot features urxvt terminal with custom colors (Xresources), compton compositing manager, a MC config with transparent background, custom zshrc and vimrc, all of which can be found in my "dotfiles" repository in the link below (in installation section). 
* Wallpaper author: unknown. If you know the author, open an issue please.
## Dependencies
* Obviously, you need fluxbox. Also, you'll need ubuntu-font-family, since I'm using these fonts in the theme.
## Installation
* Automatic: you can try using my installer script, that automatically clones the repo, applies needed configs and does much more. [Click here for the link](https://github.com/ClockGen/dotfiles).
* Manual: If the script seems bloated or works incorrectly, simply clone (or zip download) the repo to ~/.fluxbox/styles/ folder and then select theme in the fluxbox menu.
